# HackDaShit

A playful hacker simulator entertainment website featuring a classic 1980s/1990s terminal aesthetic with bright green text on a black background.

## What It Does

Enter any URL or IP address, click the "Hack It" button, and watch an animated progress bar with terminal-style feedback simulate a hacking process. After 5-7 seconds, you'll receive a playful success message. It's pure entertainment - no actual hacking involved!
